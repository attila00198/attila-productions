Hello
This is just a practice project.
Since I am currently learning PHP, I decided to make a website for myself.
This project is interesting right from the start. One is that I practice OOP. The other is that I learn the MVC model.
If you are interested in this project, feel free to download it, and if you have any comments or suggestions, please contact me.

Unfortunately, there are a few files among the project files that I noticed afterwards and I don't know how to delete them. For example is the .vscode folder.
